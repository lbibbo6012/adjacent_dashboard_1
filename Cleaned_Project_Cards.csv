i moved the netherlands 6 months ago and i’ve noticed a fierce competition among tenants to rent apartments in dutch cities. additionally, rent prices are ridiculously high. i came up with an idea for the app that would put its users in an advantageous position to rent the apartments. mvp of the app would have specs such as:
1. live scanner of apartments to rent listed at existing websites. 
2. a tinder-like matching system for people who want to live with a flatmate. 

background: 
1. currently there are a few of such scanners that are growing although none of them works well neither is properly marketed.
2. average rent price of a one bedroom is around 25% higher than price of a shared two bedroom therefore many people are willing to live with flatmates but currently the only places to find them are facebook and whatsapp groups.

why will it work:
finding an apartment to rent is a pain in the as* and  people are super desperate to rent anything.  users of our app will save themselves headaches, time and money.",,,,

simplified explanation:
it's like an automated pay-it-forward system. say, a user buys lunch and adds a voluntary 10% to 'help' the network – without expectation of return –, goes home and, by the end of the week or so, little by little, distributions of these additionals made from others within the network have recouped back 100% of the base transaction. not exactly a free lunch, but one that initial user could have again. the network 'helps' back greatly as a compound effect to those that 'need' it.

technical explanation:
the math may seem simple and perhaps simply stuck at a given state, yet it hides the overall dynamics that can only be interpreted as a whole with lots of activity within. the way it works is that transactions are made with a voluntary fee, this goes to an auxiliary account (b') of the receiver. transactions are registered reinforcing or weakening incoming and outgoing links between accounts (li & lo) and a 'metabalance' (v) is defined for each account. weighted distributions of the auxiliary accounts weaken incoming links while trying to match each account's balance up to its metabalance, emulating an extremely high yield rate, though bounded to a modified balance equation: b' + b = li - lo + v. at anytime the sum of all balances is equal to the sum of all metabalances.

since both balance (in the base) and metabalance (in the additional) are 'transacted' in the same operation, there's the option to make transactions as both (b,v) forward, one forward and the other backwards, only balance forward or only metabalance forward. this enables the possiblility to define goals within the network, for example one, to try to equate metabalance across, by sending the metabalance of the transaction to the party with the least, this would prevent 'demand collapse by liquidity strain' of base consumers, a sort of dynamic basic income.  

applications:
this could be setup as a 'spendings account' in contrast to a 'savings account'. it wouldn't have a certain periodic yield based on the amount held, but a 'gradual cashback' based on the amount of the additional on transactions made and proximity to commerce with higher network activity and spending.","cl. 24 sur #39-36, envigado, antioquia, colombia",cl. 24 sur #39-36,envigado,colombia

the problem: have you ever been to a new city and not known where the best bar scene was? of course, we all have. you may have even experienced this in miami. that's because there's no easy way of knowing which locations are busy or what the crowd is like before you go out.

our solution: a one-stop shop for nightlife. barglance is an app that connects bar-goers with bars through real-time data. we use crowd heat maps, geolocation data, and user content to let 'glancers' bar hop virtually before they head out.

market opportunity: we've identified an unmet need in a sector with little direct competition. the u.s. bar and nightclub market size is $36b, and growing at a steady 2% annually. the global market is $468b and 3%, respectively.

traction and milestones:
userbase: since the launch of barglance 3.0 in aug 2023, we have garnered users from all 50 states and over 30 countries.

key partnerships: national beverage distributors, regional event management companies, and bar partnerships across the united states.

notable app metrics:
our user retention rates are 3x the industry average
1 in 5 bar profile views results in a user visiting that bar
every 3 minutes a barglance user is looking at a bar profiles

seed round funding: we have raised just over $600k of our initial $2m seed round. at present, we are securing funding to:

grow our user base: via social media advertising, content marketing, and expanding our brand ambassador program

build our team: including a full-stack developer, marketing lead, and sales support

given our market footprint, ip, and machine learning capabilities, we believe that barglance has the potential to be the go-to product in our vertical.","113 arsenal academy place, columbia, sc 29201, usa",113 arsenal academy place,columbia,usa
