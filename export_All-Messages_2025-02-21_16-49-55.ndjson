Tiktok now is promoting image slideshows and horizontal videos,(for the new feature of full screen videos) so i would try and do both,and always say the key things in the first 3 seconds! If you keep up with trends,which if you want i can help you with,you can create a strong following in small time. Some ideas for videos/text photos: why did you make this app,which category of people would need to download it,the timeline of this project(the thinking,the doing),and whatever stuff that is relatable in whatever sense,probably whatever difficulties you’ve gone through with building your project are the same of other entrepreneurs that dream for their project to bloom,you have the perfect niche category and you’ll see how fast you’ll grow","Creation Date":"Mar 1, 2024 7:54 pm"}

You and I met back in 2016 here in A2. I've recently left JPL, and am exploring ideas to figure out my next direction. I love what you're trying to do with Adjacent, especially as it crosses in to some other projects I've been thinking about. In addition, based on your bio here it looks like we have swum in similar circles (although at different times).

You even said it yourself about interviewing at your college and the n=25 sample size not being representative of the true issues people go thru. \n\nYou share the same ideology that I do about helping people and trying to figure out the best use of their time to make them successful. \n\nI built my own platform to do all the things you wrote about. I didn’t have any clue who you were until last night and after spending 20 mins reading things you authored, it appeared we have a lot in common. \n\nI was inviting you to see what the platform was and how part of it was designed for professional services to be promoted and built upon together, with each respective entity operating on its marketplace, felt like part of the collective / community…\n\n…hence the name The One Roof Collective.  \n\nIt’s a monolith app that my whole team has been working on for two years.

What I think would be good would be to charge people for a premium membership, where they have the opportunity to earn coffee from others, but don’t make the coffee thing part of the free opportunity. You’d have to build other features for paying members, but I think that’s better than charging for the app in the App Store.","Creation Date":"Oct 28, 2024 8:52 pm"}

What is the App?\nThis app is like a special club for women who love going outside and camping. It helps them find new friends who live in different places (like other states) and want to go on fun trips together. Think of it like a big map where you can find people who also want to go camping, and you can talk to them and plan trips!\n2. How Do You Find Friends?\nThe app helps you find friends who like the same things as you, like camping or hiking. You can make a little profile (like a picture and some fun facts about yourself) so other people can see what you like. Then, the app shows you other people who also love camping, and you can say, “Hey! Let’s go camping together!”\n3. How Do You Stay Safe?\nThe app makes sure everyone is safe! You don’t have to share your name or where you live until you’re ready. It’s like wearing an invisible cape—you get to decide when people can see who you are! And if you ever feel unsure, there’s a button that lets you ask for help right away.\n4. How Do You Plan Camping Trips?\nOnce you find friends, the app lets you plan your camping trip together! It has a map that shows all the cool places where you can camp. You can pick a place, choose a date, and invite your new friends to join the trip. It’s like planning a big playdate in the forest!\n5. How Do You Talk to Friends?\nYou don’t need to call or text outside the app. There’s a special chat inside where you can send messages, just like sending notes in class! You can also send voice messages or even have video calls if you want to see each other before the trip.\n6. What’s Fun About It?\nThe app makes it fun by giving you little rewards! Every time you do something cool—like visiting a new place or planning a trip—you get badges! It’s like earning stickers for doing awesome things.\n7. What If You Want to Talk About Other Stuff?\nThere are special rooms (like chat rooms) where everyone talks about things they love—like their favorite camping spots or how to make s’mores! You can join these rooms and talk with lots of people about all kinds of fun things.\n8. How Does It Help You Find Places to Camp?\nThe app has a big map that shows all the best places to camp. It’s like having a treasure map that shows where all the fun adventures are waiting for you!\n9. Who Can Use It?\nThis app is made just for women who want to go camping safely and meet new friends from other places. It’s like having a secret club where everyone loves nature and adventure!\nIn simple terms, this app is like a magical map and clubhouse for women who love camping, helping them find new friends, plan trips together, stay safe, and have fun while earning cool rewards!","Creation Date":"Nov 7, 2024 11:13 am"}
